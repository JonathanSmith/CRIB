Depends on Apache HTTPCLIENT v 4 found here: http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client/index.html
As well as Oauth Signpost, found here: http://code.google.com/p/oauth-signpost/
For basic get requests (without oauth) it only requires java.
For 'post' and oauth authentication, it requires signpost and Apache HTTPCLIENT.
